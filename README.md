# Action-Proposal-Ranking
CVIU 2017
This folder contains demo code for our CVIU Paper, â€œUnsupervised Action Proposal Ranking through Proposal Recombination".

Since our code has several components, we have included separate files for each component; some of them can be run in parallel.
Please follow the following steps to run code files

1. Compute Action proposal in each video using any of the following code:
. https://github.com/jvgemert/apt 
. http://lear.inrialpes.fr/~oneata/3Dproposals/
. http://isis-data.science.uva.nl/cgmsnoek/pub/jain-tubelets-cvpr2014.pdf

2. Use "Calculate_opticalflow_flowMask.m"  to compute optical flow Mask in each frame of the video.
3. Use "Calculate_Motion_Score.m" to do Non_Maximal Suppression. 
4. To compute Motioness:
 4.1  After computing optical flow (as shown in "Calculate_opticalflow_flowMask or Calculate_opticalflow.m"), use edgeBoxesDemo_w in ../edge-master 
 
 4.2  Compute_Motioness.m

5. To train actioness classifier:

  5.1 Download the images provided at "http://crcv.ucf.edu/projects/videolocalization_images//#Code".

5.2 Use the code at "http://crcv.ucf.edu/projects/videolocalization_images//#Code" find action patches.  Once patches are found, use "save_Image_proposal_BBX_IM" to save top 3 patches from each image. After that, compute CNN features again on these patches using "Compute_CNN_Images" and remove noisy patches using "RandomWalk_NoisyImages".  Note that Compute_CNN_Images" and "RandomWalk_NoisyImages" are used twice; once for images and second for patches.

  5.3 Use "save_Video_proposal_BBX_IM_Neg.m" to save patches from low optical flow derivatives tubes in UCF-Sports dataset. These patches are used as negative examples to train actionness classifier. 

6.  Fine tune AlexNet using above positive and negative action images. Please see  "http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/gathered/examples/finetune_flickr_style.html", to see the example code for Fine-Tuning.

7. After fine tunning AlexNet for actionness, use "Compute_Actioness_Caffe.m" to compute actionness of each patch of action proposal.
8. Use "Compute_HOG_features.m" to compute HOG features within each patch of action proposal. 
9. Use "Compute_ProposalPath_Recombination.m" to find final new proposals.

"We are still updating the code".
